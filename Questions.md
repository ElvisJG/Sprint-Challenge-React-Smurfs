- [ ] Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Server-Side Routing(SSR) only gets data that's needed because SSR loads on a 'page by page' basis. This means SSR is a full-page refresh every single request. Client-Side Routing(CSR) has a larger initial load but allows users to move between views without refreshing the page. It requires more upfront setup, but that's abstracted a bit by current frameworks. SEO is better using SSR than CSR, but Google is making progress on making this a bit more fair.
